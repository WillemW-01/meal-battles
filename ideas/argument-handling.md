# Guidelines for argument handling

The following arguments must be supported (in any order), and all must be optional:

- `--foods <filepath>`: the relative/full path to the configuration file containing food statistics

- `--decks <filepath>`: the relative/full path to the configuration file containing the two players' decks

- `--gui`: the argument to indicate that the player wants to display the GUI.
