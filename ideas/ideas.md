# Meal Battle Ideas

- each card has a manacost stat instead of a mana pool
- each card has a special ability that can only be played under certain conditions
- each ability has a 1 turn cooldown
- cards that are defeated can be metabolised and be reused in some way (poop)
- point system for allowing players to come back?
- rock-paper-scissors system? specialised deck good vs balanced deck,
  but balanced deck good vs another type of deck
- discard some cards? not all cards on the board
- random deck type: girl dinner (not good against a balanced deck, but good against a specialised deck)

## Deck type ideas from Bing:

`Healthy deck`: A deck that is based on nutritious and wholesome food, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, etc. A healthy deck could have a bonus to mana and defense, or a special ability that heals or protects the player or their cards. For example, a banana card could have a high mana value and a healing effect, or a broccoli card could have a high defense value and a shield effect.
`Junk food deck`: A deck that is based on unhealthy and processed food, such as chips, candy, soda, fast food, etc. A junk food deck could have a bonus to attack and speed, or a special ability that damages or debuffs the opponent or their cards. For example, a hot dog card could have a high attack value and a piercing effect, or a cola card could have a high speed value and a stun effect.
`Spicy deck`: A deck that is based on spicy and flavorful food, such as chili, curry, salsa, wasabi, etc. A spicy deck could have a bonus to special effects and abilities, or a special ability that triggers or enhances the effects and abilities of the player or their cards. For example, a chili card could have a low cost and a fire effect, or a curry card could have a high cost and a boost effect.
`Sweet deck`: A deck that is based on sweet and delicious food, such as cake, ice cream, chocolate, honey, etc. A sweet deck could have a bonus to HP and happiness, or a special ability that restores or increases the HP and happiness of the player or their cards. For example, a cake card could have a high HP value and a regeneration effect, or a chocolate card could have a high happiness value and a charm effect.
