# Food group strengths and weaknesses

## Passives:

These are effects that are activated when certain foods are paired together or belong to the same group. They can be positive or negative, depending on the compatibility of the foods. For example:

**Milk and Cookies** - When a dairy and a grain food are paired together, they increase their health and mana by 10%.

**Fruit Salad** - When three or more fruit foods are in the same group, they increase their movement speed and critical chance by 10%.

**Cheese and Wine** - When a dairy and a fruit food are paired together, they increase their damage and defence by 10%, but reduce their accuracy and movement speed by 10%.

**Meat and Potatoes** - When a protein and a vegetable food are paired together, they increase their health and defence by 10%, but reduce their mana and movement speed by 10%.

**Sushi** - When a protein and a grain food are paired together, they increase their mana and movement speed by 10%, but reduce their health and defence by 10%.

**Junk Food** - When two or more foods that have low nutritional value are in the same group, they reduce their health and mana by 10%.

## Interactions:

**Fruit** > **Dairy** - Fruit foods deal 150% damage to dairy foods, because fruit foods are acidic and can spoil dairy foods

**Dairy** < **Fruit** - Dairy foods deal 50% damage to fruit foods, because dairy foods are bland and can’t compete with fruit foods

**Vegetable** > **Protein** - Vegetable foods deal 150% damage to protein foods, because vegetable foods are rich in fiber and can digest protein foods

**Protein** < **Vegetable** - Protein foods deal 50% damage to vegetable foods, because protein foods are heavy and can’t catch up with vegetable foods

**Grain** > **Vegetable** - Grain foods deal 150% damage to vegetable foods, because grain foods are starchy and can absorb vegetable foods

**Vegetable** < **Grain** - Vegetable foods deal 50% damage to grain foods, because vegetable foods are watery and can’t penetrate grain foods

**Protein** > **Grain** - Protein foods deal 150% damage to grain foods, because protein foods are sharp and can cut grain foods

**Grain** < **Protein** - Grain foods deal 50% damage to protein foods, because grain foods are soft and can’t resist protein foods

**Dairy** > **Protein** - Dairy foods deal 150% damage to protein foods, because dairy foods are creamy and can melt protein foods

**Protein** < **Dairy** - Protein foods deal 50% damage to dairy foods, because protein foods are dry and can’t moisten dairy foods

**Fruit** = **Grain** - Fruit foods deal 100% damage to grain foods, because fruit foods are sweet and can complement grain foods

**Grain** = **Fruit** - Grain foods deal 100% damage to fruit foods, because grain foods are crunchy and can contrast fruit foods

**Dairy** = **Vegetable** - Dairy foods deal 100% damage to vegetable foods, because dairy foods are smooth and can balance vegetable foods

**Vegetable** = **Dairy** - Vegetable foods deal 100% damage to dairy foods, because vegetable foods are fresh and can refresh dairy foods

# Chat GPT Ideas:

## Positive Food Pairings (Buffs):

Protein and Grains Combo (Balanced Diet): When a character combines a protein and a grain in their meal, they gain a passive bonus that increases their overall health points (HP) by a certain percentage due to the balanced nutritional intake.

Fruit and Dairy Combo (Vitamin Boost): Combining fruits and dairy products in a meal provides a passive bonus, boosting mana points (MP) regeneration rate because of the rich vitamin content.

Vegetables and Grains Combo (Energy Blend): Combining vegetables and grains in a meal grants a passive ability to increase movement speed (MS) since the energy from grains and the nutrients from vegetables create an energy-packed combination.

## Negative Food Pairings (Debuffs):

Fruit and Protein Combo (Digestive Conflict): Combining fruits and proteins in a meal results in a passive debuff. The digestion of these two categories is less efficient when combined, reducing the effectiveness of any special abilities or spells cast by the character.

Dairy and Grains Combo (Lactose Intolerance): Combining dairy and grains may lead to a passive debuff for some characters who are lactose intolerant, reducing their defense (DEF) because of digestive discomfort.

Protein and Vegetable Combo (Antagonistic Nutrients): The combination of proteins and vegetables can lead to a passive debuff in some cases, reducing attack damage (DMG) because certain nutrients in these food groups may counteract each other.

## Food Group Interactions (Damage Modifiers):

Protein vs. Grains (Satiety Advantage): Proteins deal more damage to grains because they provide a sense of fullness, reducing the effectiveness of the grain-based characters' abilities.

Dairy vs. Fruits (Vitamin Clash): Dairy-based characters deal more damage to fruit-based characters, representing a competition for nutrients and vitamins.

Grains vs. Vegetables (Energy Boost): Grains deal more damage to vegetable-based characters, as the energy from grains can overpower the nutrient-rich vegetables.
